Few of my ideas for a fulfilled life.

### Awesome Body:
   * Everyday sweat & achieve personal best in at least 1 exercise.
   * Watch your posture when you sit, walk and sleep
   * Sleep at 10:30pm and wake up at 4:30am [maintain internal clock]
   * Eat at right intervals and skip if its past due time

### Life style :
   * Wardrobe is for washed and ironed clothes [Do it yourself]
   * Clear torn and faded shirts from every day use [not even for home wear]
   * Buy a fresh pair of sock and inner wear regularly.
   * Get haircut once a month, Trim beard twice a week.
   * Clean room/home once a week.

### Open Mind:
   * Read/Listen and summarize one non fiction book each week #mytakeaway.
   * Try something new just for sake of trying.
   * Listen to podcasts than video surfing

### Finance :
   * Invest 100Rs every month into a seperate account [PayTM]

### Scoring Professional Goals:
   * Invest on building novel ideas and designs every week>
   * Document your work for past week and plan for the upcoming one.

### Better Relationships:
   * Call at-least one unique person every week just to keep in touch.
   * Try to bring one new person year into your life every year.
   * Try Dates and Hangout

### Intone Musician:
   * Learn one new trick/song each week.
   * Invest time for deliberate practice.

### Mastering a Foreign Language:
   * Watch at-least 1 foreign movie / Binge watch a season of a TV series in a week
   * Listen to regional songs other than Kannada

### Technolust:
   * Once a week browse internet for latest development in tech.
   * Learn something apart from work related objectives.

### Limit or Get rid of:
   * Meloncholy of the past, Judgement in the present and worrying about the future
   * Porn [kaamasutra is acceptable], Smoking/Drinking [once in a month is acceptable]. The more one involves in pleasure the more they will forgo their chances at joy creating activities like Dating, Courtship, Bonding, Intimacy, Vulnerability, Endurance of Pain, Acceptance of Reality.
   * Unhealthy eating habits and Fast Food.
   * Youtube binge, Primevideo/Netflix binge, Popcorn binge
   * Don't invest time in other projects on weekdays
   * Stop discussing philosophy or collecting quotables
   * Avoid using phones and distractions while eating
