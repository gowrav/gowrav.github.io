I am not an expert but I do have a sound advice given my adventures of finding love.

First, lets clear the nonsense. It's not love.!
All the feelings and emotions you feel when you look at someone and start to develop immense need to be with and build a beautiful future together, yeah.. that has nothing to do with love.
The feeling is just the rush of anxiety and uncertainty that helps flourish the possibilities of your imaginations.
This will fade in time... Just give it some time. It will fade much quicker if you actually complete the cycle.
For the lack of a better word lets call it the **pursuit**

Love is much more simpler to define but very difficult to understand.
> Love is what keeps you alive

This post is an excerpt on the advice I passed on to my friend recently when he asked.

**What do you think, if one gets an idea that she is too beautiful for you to deserve?**

Look, we humans are inherently irrational, we have animal instincts what messes things up is that we want to make sense of good, bad, happy, sad anything and everything that happens to us, to explain everything we feel., and more often than not it needs to be acceptable in the society the more you think the more you end up creating irrational meaning which ends up solving nothing.

This is all fine to an extent but the problem rises when it starts to question or worse depreciating one's own value or worthiness.

Whatever he said falls along the same lines...

### Most of us will not agree with what comes next, becuase its a bitter truth.

> Men desire women for their beauty and women desire men for their status ...

"**status**" in our society is closely related to financial stability, and in India its now a father's duty to find a "secure" home for his daughter to procreate. In accordance to this, today more and more men have started crushing their ambitions and dreams in an illogical *pursuit* of *settling*. Typically men with money feel they are worthy and have the luxury of rejection, when we don't have enough of it we feel less worthy and feel dejected. 

Luckily, this is not the complete story.


Let's make it a bit personal..
***Have you ever felt that you don't deserve that girl because she's too beautiful?***

I don't anymore., If I find a woman attractive, I would definitely try my luck with her.

> Imagine the worst possible thing that can happen if you ask her out.!, It's infinitely better than beliving she is not for you.

I would put it this way.

![Courage to be You](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-87a8c62ef46985b6632ec1a66fee1502)

>The whole universe is here for you to take action, to conquer your wildest dreams. For any thoughts which says otherwise just put it on hold for 100years. You can revisit that later.

This is the first step.

##### Pointers who have taken the first step.
For starters,
if you keep eyeballing her profile, it means you have paused your life in pursuit which is not good. remove her number from contacts. Don't keep tabs on her social media accounts or worse don't keep re-viewing her pics.

As a man of faith I can suggest, to pray once to god or universe or just nudge your subconscious that you want to meet this crush of yours face to face by end of the year. This part of the puzzle is not under our control but asking for help is the only move that works.

Trust me it will happen, and when you get that chance.. folow this 2 step rule.

1. Introduce yourself to your pursuit, give her a hint on how she can reach you. [could be a mutual friend reference, insta, or what not]
2. Tell her that you admire her presence in this world and ask her out on a date.

She will probably say *No*. or atlest some relative version of it, like not now. or something...this is all rejections. just without the back bone to admit it.

When she does.. Say "thanks for considering" and just walk away. **Don't make any excuses or give second chances.**

##### What the actual F?
The trick is you need to start taking rejections casually, without any intense thoughts about what it means to you or your future. You will get better at dealing with these feelings and in the process you will completely remove your sense of worth from being questioned at any point in your life.

You would have started "loving yourself". This is a level up that one needs to achieve. Loving oneself means you attract more people to love you for who you are.
The unconditional kind.

I have got rejected so many times, some were a joy in retrospect. Rejections doesn't mean much to my value or worthiness.

No matter what my friend Manoj keeps saying, My worthiness have never been this antifragile before, everyone needs to develop that.

At inception it's totally normal to feel inadequate, you will be scared of loosing your shot, your mind keeps telling you to back down, to limit yourself in the comfort zones this is trait that has kept us alive for thousand's of years to do what is not risky in this case one which doesn't damage your sense of self.

I had struggled with this feeling for two years. I was desperate. I felt worthless for days together, I couldn't live without doing what was necessary but couldn't handle rejections well.
Many days I had wept myself to sleep. Whenever I used to meeet the girl I was in pursuit of, I used to ask her availabilty to see if I have chance, looking back it was a low status move. Made me very needy, I had the anxiety about missing out. All in all that was the journey necessary to grow.


##### So why even ask when the trick is to Walk Away?
Rejection is a double edge sword, it cuts both ways. You get to weild it's power by accepting it.
Accept rejections gracefully and you will master it.

When you get rejected, saying "Thanks for Considering" and "Walking Away" is the most vulnerable and most powerful thing any Real Man can do...

This is what makes man a Superior Being, it makes him worthy of any woman., and no amount of money can buy it. What happens after this is not in our control, but more often than not it works out.

## Ok., what if she says "Yes".?
Congratulations, You have come to the end of this journey.
