I am not an expert but I do have a sound advice given my adventures of finding love.

First, lets clear the nonsense. It's not love.!
All the feelings and emotions you feel when you look at someone and start to develop immense need to be with and build a beautiful future together, yeah.. that has nothing to do with love.
The feeling is just the rush of anxiety and uncertainty that helps flourish the possibilities of your imaginations.
This will fade in time... Just give it some time. It will fade much quicker if you actually complete the cycle.
For the lack of better word lets call it **pursuit**

Love is much more simpler to define but very difficult to understand.
> Love is what keeps you alive

This post is an excerpt on the advice I passed on to my friend recently when he asked.

**What do you think, if one gets an idea that she is too beautiful for you to deserve?**

Look, we humans are inherently irrational, we have animal instincts what messes things up is that we want to make sense of good, bad, happy, sad anything and everything that happens to us, to explain everything we feel., and more often than not it needs to be acceptable in the society the more you think the more you end up creating irrational meaning which ends up solving nothing.

This is all fine to an extent but the problem rises when it starts to question or worse depreciating one's own value or worthiness.

Whatever he said falls along the same lines...

### Most of us will not agree with what comes next, becuase its a bitter truth.

![Oscar Wilde Quote](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2829356/88017956-5f947180-cb44-11ea-8026-ba013389cad1.png)

> Men desire women for their beauty and women desire men for their status ...

"**status**" in our society is closely related to financial stability and when we don't have enough of it we feel less worthy. Typically men with money feel they are worthy and have the luxury of rejection.
Which is true.
Luckily, this is not the complete story.

In regards to his second question

**Have you ever felt that you don't deserve that girl because she's too beautiful?**

I don't anymore., If I find a woman attractive, I would definitely try my luck with her.

> Imagine the worst possible thing that can happen if you ask her out.!, It's infinitely better than beliving she is not for you.

I would put it this way.

>The whole universe is here for you to take action, to conquer your wildest dreams. For any thoughts which says otherwise just put it on hold for 100years. You can revisit that later.

This is the first step.

##### Pointers who have taken the first step.
For starters,
if you keep eyeballing her profile, it means you have paused your life in pursuit which is not good. remove her number from contacts. Don't keep tabs on her social media accounts or worse don't keep re-viewing her pics.

As a man of faith I can suggest, to pray once to god or universe or just nudge your subconscious that you want to meet this crush of yours face to face by end of the year. This part of the puzzle is not under our control but asking for help is the only move that works.

Trust me it will happen, and when you get that chance.. folow this 2 step rule.

1. Introduce yourself to your pursuit, give her a hint on how she can reach you. [could be a mutual friend reference, insta, or what not]
2. Tell her that you admire her presence in this world and ask her out on a date.

She will probably say *No*. or atlest some relative version of it, like not now. or something...this is all rejections. just without the back bone to admit it.

When she does.. Say "thanks for considering" and just walk away. **Don't make any excuses or give second chances.**

##### What the actual F?
The trick is you need to start taking rejections casually, without any intense thoughts about what it means to you or your future. You will get better at dealing with these feelings and in the process you will completely remove your sense of worth from being questioned at any point in your life.
You would have started loving yourself.

I have got rejected so many times, some were a joy in retrospect. it doesn't mean much to my value or worthiness.

No matter what my friend Manoj keeps telling about me. I know my worth is much higher than most,

Everyone needs to develop that.

At initiation it's completely normal to feel inadequate, you will be scared of loosing your shot and your mind keeps telling you to back down and limit yourself to comfort zones that which won't damage your sense of self respect.

I had the same fear 2 years ago. I was desperate to prove my worth. I couldn't live without knowing and couldn't tollerate rejections. Many days I had wept myself to sleep. Every single time I met the girl I was pursuing, I used to ask her if she got engaged or found a match.
It was a low status move. I felt the anxiety about missing out.


##### So why even ask when the trick is to Walk Away?
Rejection is a double edge sword., it cuts both ways. By accepting it you will master it.

When you get rejected, saying "Thanks" and "Walking Away" is the most vulnerable and most powerful thing any Real Man can do...

This is what makes Man a Superior Being, it makes him worthy of any woman., and no amount of money can buy it. What happens after this is not in our control, but more often than not it works out.


## Ok., what if she says Yes.?
Congratulations, You have come to the end of the journey.
