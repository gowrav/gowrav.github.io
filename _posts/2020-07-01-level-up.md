They say memory can be a curse or a boon, and for the majority of my life I considered it as the later while the last couple of years it turned out to be anything but that.

Mind and body have a great similey when it comes to wounds they both leave scars, although plastic surgery for the later and lobotomy for the former can help they are neither perfect nor natural. More over we are here to grow and just go through, to grow one must let him or herself out of their comfort zone and give the freedom to fail that essentially entails wounds and scars. Now that we know its going to be there as the grades and certificates for us levelling up in out life, let's just get comfortable in its existance throught out our life and not just that but rather own it with pride.
