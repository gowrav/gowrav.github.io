I am happy to say that, I have grown much more in the last 10days than I had in past decade.

I am a delight with kids..and very nurturing, they love me.

My parents and guardians behave well with me.. I hold the power to ask their problem when they complain about me.

Ask valid questions than following rat race when parents criticize.

My friends like my company and want to hang around...even when I showed my flaws.

I have become good friends to many who weren't in my life 2 years ago.

I handled my rejection well., and apologized for my destructive thinking with my ex.

I am getting good at responding without emotional overflow where I can be humble and open without giving up myself.

I have learnt to not raise my words when in a conversation and argument.

I am helping and improving life of others just by thinking.

I have learnt to accept and let go of my reflections like never before.

I found god and he is pouring love into my heart ðŸ’“.
