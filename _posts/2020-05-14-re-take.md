I am on my bed supposedly trying to get an internet connection for the audio call discussing the gory details of drm turn kit reciever that I couldn't build to a newly made friend living in Germany with his koorg wife as the lady I was madly in love with walks into the room ducks in to the space between the wardrobe and the cot to remove something from her bag she had stacked their when she came to our home as an uninvited refuge of some pandemic.
The voice comes through as I recieve the call.
"G how are you" both of them ask., I realise it's a video call and I see the couple for the first time together on the display screen and I accidentally reveal the angry lady ducked and on call with possibly her fiancee who looks into the camera for just a second...

I jump off the bed and walk out of the room as of nothing happened as the friend and his wife wanted to see the girl they missed.. As if purposefully I skidded from their to not show get and they insist...

I come out of my front door... Trying not to reveal the context of my existence where everything just happened to be there for no reason that I can formulate...

I fidget and pace around front porch of my home while my friend is giving me a look for my demeanor.. trying not to sound loud and explain why I can't put her in the video call for my German friends.. I try to remember her name it's something with G..., I don't remember oh it hits me now.... It's guni th ha and I don't have explanation of what to rationalize.., I murmured she doesn't like me so I can't put her on call..
I could only remember that she hated me because I wrote her a letter and sent it to her office address... 
He wants to talk to her.., I say no.., but their she is just walking into the porch out of my front door.. I handed her the phone and said it's a friend he wants to talk to you...
I can already register the cinik and sarcasm in her thoughts.., she says who is this and why should I talk and put the phone to her ear.. And says hi., She is not thrilled after initial conversation.., I am guessing that he is trying to tell what a good guy I am and she is refuting the same by mentioning all the things I did..

She walks away from me around the corner of my house and disappears as he tries to walk her back on the mind mine that I have with his perspective...

I don't know what they are talking about..I am only speculating here. I can sit their and visualizer see her face but it's not the same smooth skin I used to know it's different, but I know I liked her for the maturity and that's available on that face..I know I love her no matter how she looks on the outside.

She comes back towards me Turing the corner of the home and walking briskly.. I sit on the porch tile slab.. Anticipating nothing specific as she Hurdles the phone on the pots array there., She is not mad just being mean...
I pick it up.. I know that I paid a good deal of money for that hardware probably flagship model Pixie from a branded lineup..

I check it seems unharmed.. I don't know what to ask or say...I deserve this I guess...

I am still on the call... And there are other family members now watching me... 

I say why did you have to throw the phone... And she says... She replies "wanted to know how hastily you behave when things don't go your way"..."Will try .." 

What is she saying... Does she want to give my love a shot?? What just happened... Did she just forgive my past and looked at me in a new light


I don't know what's real anymore.. Sure it feels real...

You did all you could and try to win her and by pushing hard on the roads you never knew could take you there.., ended by what you knew...
Now something has changed something can mean nothing.. It's hopeless or the only hope you have it's completely meaningless or the only thing that makes sense in the sucking universe... What will you do...

# I woke up from a surreal dream...

The end
