One of my favourite character in DC comics is Flash and more specifically Barry Allen version of Flash. He is one of the strongest ❤️ and Mind to exist in the universe. Inshort Barry always carried the burden of tragic murder of his mom and falseful incarnation of his father in his heart which consumed happiness of his childhood life., 

Once he became Flash he started helping people in ways he didn't think possible, and over years of thoughtful understanding of his power and it's capabilities to go back in time he finally goes back, long back to his childhood in an attempt to save his mom and there by creating a normal childhood for himself.

This is called Flashpoint.

Once he did that, he loses all his powers and over the next course of years he realises that world is doomed because of it.

He eventually looses all that he cared for and cherished in his life while the people from the original timeline are strangers still.

Living the life he always wanted to live he relaizes the penance, later he gathers more courage which even scares batman to his core to get back to the original timeline and unfathomable serinity to accept that, things needs to be as they are for a reason and hoping and trying to rewrite the past only causes more pain.

So back to my Flashpoint., At the moment of writing this post it feels like everyone close to me knows what's my Flashpoint and strangely it happened exactly 2 years ago.

My Flashpoint was Guniverse and over the past 2 years all I tried was to change the outcome of my relationship with her. She always saw me has an acquaintance and I always as a soulmate.

It has been 6 meetups so far with her 3 of which were on my request and other 3 circumstantial.
Everyone of those has been my attempt in rigging the outcome and essential failing at it., These are filled with range of actions and emotions which I never took with anyone in my life so far and even as I write this blog all I can imagine are the possibilities universe can take that can lead to the desired outcome., none which involves any of my doing. I know atleast a few who would argue that thinking is the most powerful thing in this universe and as such the possibility of the desired outcome is closer than you think.

Now this is the point where the wisdom inevitably is the key., Universe is all knowing and all powerful and that what ever comes to pass is just an unfolding and as such it's necessary to accept that one has to do everything he possibly can for fulfillment of his hearts wishes and realise to let go of the outcome once done with it.

I did show every part of my being, every interaction with her different from the previous, only to realise that with each take she is unattainable and more over she didn't even try., neither does she remember the moments I so monumentally cherished the very essence of what was pulling me so much towards her... I tore the pages and burnt the boats and bridges to be forgotten and hated but she offers a hand at acquaintance without unmasking her feelings, trying to look normal when there was never such a thing in my heart and "that" she's knows.

This pain is much heavier than words can describe, when she looks at you with a friendly face and all you want is a 'slap' or a kiss on the lips, but all you get is that non nonchalant look of an acquaintance.

This is that instant of time and space., Where I let go of anything to do with this past 2 years, let go of all possibilities of the future that holds both of us and ends the post write where it started.

At Flashpoint.
