### Book
The print font and format of the book is visibly the most pleasant for a text intensive book I have ever read. The lack of pictures can be written off for an intimate and imaginative narration of concepts and places.

### Audio Book
Mark Manson does a wonderful job in bringing his blog posts into audio format. His delivery is excellent and narration very crisp for listener of any pace. The audio book of Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck is a double distilled on the rocks drink of absolute delight.

### Content Summary
The book is split into 9 chapters that are interconnected to take the reader through motions of life starting at the rock bottom "Don't Try" to point of absolute freedom "...And Then You Die... Something Beyond Ourselves The Sunny Side Of Death". Each chapter is self contained but have subtle thread woven to reveal a bigger picture.

### Context Summary
The author shows off at every turn his immaculate skills of articulating huge life dramas into bite sized digestible anecdotes which encompasses those of Charles Bukowski, Gautama Buddha, Hiroo Onada and Norio Suzuki, Dave Mustain and Pete Best, William James, Malala Yousafzai, Earnest Becker while walking through one very intimately known by him which is his own.

### #my takeaway
   * Life is as hard or easy as we make it to be.
   * Backwards Law - Trying too hard to get what  you want in life—like love, respect, and happiness—often has the  opposite effect: you end up lonely, dejected, and miserable.
   * Good problems underline great life, while shitty problems underline mediocre ones.
   * Not giving a fuck doesn't mean being different, it means to be comfortable in being different (aka original!)
   * To not give a fuck about adversity, one must first give a fuck about something more important than adversity.
   * Whether we consciously see or not, we are always giving a fuck about something.
   * Only through pain one can appreciate pleasure
   * Instant gratification comes at the cost of everlasting joy.
   * Happiness is not a solvable equation, Dissatisfaction and unease are part of life.
   * Happiness is a side effect of solving problems, and is a constant work in progress.
   * Choose your struggle and commit yourself to seeing it through.
   * Entitlement is an adversary of progress. Entitlement can be for success or for failures both are an illusion to not take personal responsibility.
   * Self Awareness Onion - Take account of your life as is to know who you are...wait...Don't try to know who you are, belief about who you are can devoid you from experiencing who you can be... so instead peel yourself like an onion and experience life layer by layer.
   * The hand your are dealt by so called fate at any point doesn't necessarily determine your future and the life of every person in the book articulates the same.
   * To live a life of meaning we need to focus on what we value the most and how we measure it (metrics).
   * Shitty values are influenced by outside events and circumstances.
   * Great values are actualized internally.
   * Values should be reality based and motivating.  
        + Responsibility - Take personal responsibility no matter who's fault it is.
        + Uncertainty - Doubt's create new path's while certainty is a dead end.
        + Failure - Discovering flaws and mistakes helps in becoming a master.
        + Rejection - saying and hearing "No" helps to value "Yes"  
        + Death - Contemplation of mortality can help in acting without expectation.
   * Growth is an iterative process, unless you are wrong about something / everything you can't grown in it., remember you are never right but less wrong.
   * Do Something principle - Action isn't just the effect of motivation; its' also cause of it. Desirable Action -> Emotional Inspiration -> Motivation -> Desirable Action.
   * Inspiration is for amateurs, rest of us just get to work

### Closure
Great self help book primarily written to be a complement for many of the "Do Good, See Good..." oriented pure positivity propellant books, brings a balance to seeing good and bad like the middle way preached by Buddha. It has lot of good reference for deeper studying as below and is a good book for depressed people.
