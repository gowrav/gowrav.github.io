I am a 29 year old grown ass man who has come home for a week off and to spend time with mom on her 58th Birthday, forget getting her an expensive gift or jewellery I couldn't even get her a drink of her choice having ended up with barely 101 Rs in my account on her birthday and all I could think was how can I bake a cake at home with what I have.

I wrote the above line with tears in my eyes, No., I am not overly emotional rather people who know me will tell you that I am overly logical. So what happens once in a while is just that every possibility of normalcy I rejected to be exactly where I am right now tries to push me over the edge and I just surrender.
