I am a 29 year old grown ass man who has come home for a week off and to spend time with mom on her 58th Birthday, forget getting her an expensive gift or jewellery I couldn't even get her a drink of her choice having ended up with barely 101 Rs in my account on her birthday and all I could think was how can I bake a cake at home with what I have.

I wrote the above line with tears in my eyes, No., I am not overly emotional rather people who know me will tell you that I am overly logical. So what happens once in a while is just that every possibility of normalcy I rejected to be exactly where I am right now tries to push me over the edge and I just surrender.

When I left Bangalore this past Saturday, I carried ~2400Rs with me., rode the whole way at high speeds but very cautiously and just before reaching hassan was met with an accident which costed me 2300 for repair of the vehicle itself (that which doesn't belong to me).,
There is no better way to say it but "embarrassed" specially today, i broke my spectacles right in my hand and had to borrow 2k from my brother for its repair
. The credit cards are virtually useless where I live but has made me specially calm to just be open about my financially limits with strangers. Since I have no source to pay 10k advance for my brother's vehicle repair after the accident which I had been using as my daily ride as my own (add shame where needed) I have asked him for the same, apart from 40k I owe him for the house rent taken recently. Oh yeah and for Mom's birthday I had to borrow money from her to get the drink she wanted which was heart wrenching on itself.

Right now around days of Corona It's not a great time for most people, I know!, but I have declined opportunities which came my way to make some money in the mean time when my angle investor is reluctant or unable to add funds for the startup with so much potential.
It's a much harder fact to digest that the team has little or no trust in each other and I am barely holding on to the thread of hope where things can continue to work.

My personal life has been a mess for the last 2 years and most of it has been my attempt at building trust and vulnerability based relationship although ironically I couldn't build one myself or rather failed spectacularly over and over and over again. It's been so clearly shown to me that today all that works is money and status and which I so lag at this juncture that its not attainable.  Oh and its a perfect place for the girl I was once so desperate about to point and show why exactly she rejected me in the first place {I don't have a feeling at this point}. 

Well its rock bottom on my emotional pit and financial one too., but things can be normal atleast what normal for most is.. to get myself on track even after 5 years.., If only I take a turn now...."just take left"

I know my capabilites, I know I will be earning better and will catch up to my classmates and friends within couple of years and I can have the life most people only dream of with a well planned retirement., A steady source not only for myself but for my parents and kids...it's not late to take this left. Well even my closest friends have told me how worthless my current existence is and how that can be retuned and changed with a simple decision of ending this trial I have put myself on.

~~Where there's nothing going right.
