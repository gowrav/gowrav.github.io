I am a 29 year old grown ass man who has come home for a week off and to spend time with mom on her 58th Birthday, forget getting her an expensive gift or jewellery I couldn't even get her a drink of her choice having ended up with barely 101 Rs in my account on her birthday and all I could think was how can I bake a cake at home with what I have.

I wrote the above line with tears in my eyes, No., I am not overly emotional rather people who know me will tell you that I am overly logical. So what happens once in a while is just that every possibility of normalcy I rejected to be exactly where I am right now tries to push me over the edge and I just surrender.

When I left Bangalore this past Saturday, I carried ~2400Rs with me and just before reaching hassan was met with an accident which costed me 2300 for repair of the vehicle itself that which doesn't belong to me., There is no better way to say it but embarrassed to my core specially today, i broke my spectacles right in my hand and had to borrow 2k from my brother or fthe repair and have no source to pay 10k advance for the , Right now It's not a great time for most people I know and I have declined opportunities which came my way to make some money in the time I am spending here with the family or more like when my angle investor is unable to raise funds for the new startup. It's a much harder fact to digest that the team has little or no trust in each other and I am barely holding on to the thread of hope where things can continue to work.

My personal life has been a mess and most of it has been my attempt at building trust and vulnerability based relationship although ironically I could build one myself or rather failed spectacularly over and over. 

I know exactly how to get myself on track only if take a turn now....just take left ... I will be earning beyond any of your classmates and friends within couple of years and I can have the life most people only dream of with a well planned retirement., A steady source not only for myself but for my parents and kids...it's not late to take this left., Well even your closest friends have told you how worthless your current existence is and how that can change with a simple decisionof ending this trial...
When there's nothing going right.
