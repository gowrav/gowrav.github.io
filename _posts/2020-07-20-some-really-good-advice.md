Things that I learnt over my first adventure of finding love

First of all..It's not about love, all the feelings and emotions you feel when you look at someone you start to have crush on had nothing to do with love., It's the rush of anxiety and uncertainty that flourishes the possibilities of your imaginations.. This will fade in time... Just give it some time.

Here is the advice I passed on to my friend recently when he said..
What do you think, if one gets an idea that she is too beautiful for you to deserve?

Look we humans are inherently irrational as we have animal instincts but we want to make sense of something good or bad that happens to us...to give meaning to all that we feel... and more you think the more you end up creating meaning for it.

That's fine to an extent but it shouldn't end up depreciating one's own value or worthiness..

Whatever he said is along the same lines...

Men desire women for their beauty and women desire men for their status ...

" status " in our society is closely related to financial stability and once we don't have enough of it we feel less worthy... typically men with money feel they are worthy and has the luxury of rejection..... 
Which is true.
But this is not the complete story...

In regards to his second question
Have you ever felt that you don't deserve that girl because she's too beautiful?

I don't anymore...I definitely would try my luck with her.

Imagine the worst possible thing that can happen if you ask her out... 

It's infinitely better than beliving she is not for you...

I would put it this way...the whole universe is here for you to take action...to conquer your wildest dreams ...for any thoughts which says otherwise just put it on hold for 100years..
You can revisit that later.


Once you start taking rejections casually without any intense thoughts about what it means to you...you will be get better at dealing with this feeling..

I have got rejected so many times some were a joy in retrospect... it doesn't mean much to my value or worthiness...

no matter what Manoj says...I know my worth is much higher than most...
One needs to develop that....

It's completely normal to feel inadequate
You are scared of loosing your shot ...as I was 2years ago...it makes you desperate...
Every single time I met the girl I was desperate about I used to ask her if she got engaged or found a guy.
It's a low status move... You feel the anxiety about missing out.


For starters once you have initiated the conversation.
Remove her number from contacts if you keep eyeballing her profile,
Don't keep tabs on her social media accounts or keep reviewing her pics.


Only once pray to god or universe or ask your subconscious that you want to meet this crush of yours face to face by end of the year...
Trust me it will happen...and when you get that chance just ask her out on a date..


She will probably say No.
If she does..
Say thanks for considering and just walk away...

That's the most vulnerable and most powerful thing any Real Man can do...

This is what makes Man desirable and worthy for a woman...no amount of money can buy it.

When she says Yes..., You have come to the end of the journey.
