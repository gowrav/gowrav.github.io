Ahhh... This is where the fun starts..

Congratulations on finishing the first step of getting yourself an opening 😉, that was not easy trust me.

So., what's the game you ask.?

![Bee 🐝 You. ](https://www.wallquotes.com/sites/default/files/insp0250_02.jpg)

The game consists of only one rule and No matter what the situation demands you aren't supposed to break you.
This is the only way you will be the prize of this game, by being relentlessly unapologeticlly you.

You will look like an ass hole and a self sufficient prick., Guess what works?

![Be Love](https://www.hdwallpapers.in/download/be_love_be_proud_be_you_quotes_4k-HD.jpg)

I will set an example:
Your pursuit isn't favouring your bagpacking idea, you feel she is excited to go with you but doesn't like the destination..

What you should do is ask her where she wants to go and plan accordingly.. right?

Wrong.!! It's not the destination remember, it's the company., By considering her suggestion you compromised your own idea as if it was stupid.
Best relationship exists because they don't compromise on themselves ever. They do things for each other but not at cost of their own.

Remember the quote by Oscar Wilde.
> Everything is about sex; except sex, Sex is about power.!!

Stay true to it.., even fight for it..!! Tell her that we can replan but you want to stick to your destination and do it.

Be vulnerable but never try to be nice nor narcissistic for that matter.

No body likes an ass kisser certainly not a lady with ounce of self exteem.

However there is a caveat to this, if the original idea came from her about the bag packing trip then go with the flow.
You have more to show off by accepting the situations as is than giving your two cents in adapting it.

It's the manly way of handling things. Most people can't see the subtlety in this.. sadly this can't be thought you need to learn my making mistakes.

Moral of the story
Never compromise your identity for a short term pleasure. 
Most needy man fall into the trap of being flexible to the situation to showcase dependability but what they fail to recognise is that only by being true to one's own identity you become the most powerful object for others to gravitate towards.
You start pulling people into your region of influence when you don't compromise. Not only that, you will soon realise that more situations crop up on your life to fulfill your desires.

This is definitely not easy, but doing so brings the best in everything that you try.

No matter how unlikely the situation gets never ever take shortcuts, never give in to pressure, never try to be someone you are not, be self-reliant and resilient enough to let go of your pursuit.,

Don't pull any kind of stunts. There will be plenty of situations where you will feel like doing something incredibly poetic, like writing a letter, showing up at her door unannounced, sending flowers and what not.
These are all great ways of expressing yourself but before sex these are desperation moves no matter how reasonable they feel.

I advocate doing this when you truly have power.,ie you had sex with this pursuit or when you are engaged.

Yeah stupid.!! the rules apply for your whole life..?!!

Realistically speaking the life is never dependent on that one stunt that changes all.., it looks great on the silver screen but isn't true...

Ironically life takes a very subtle approach. The more comfortable you are with being yourself the better it works.

No woman wants a man who keeps chasing after her, it's a low power move once you have successfully gotten her attention and you have showed that you desire her in all your rawness of being ....Stop Chasing..!!!! Please STOP!!!!

Stillness is the key..be patient because the women will always work their way back to what truly keeps them intrigued. Not being shaken by them is the best there is.

Most will flake out, but that shouldn't drive you desperate this needs to be your moto. 

Remember if You don't bend.. Everything will.
